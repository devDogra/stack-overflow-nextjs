1. components -> smaller reusable comps like forms, cards, etc
2. constants -> self expln, also for link info [ { title: "Home", route: "/home" }] etc.
3. app -> everything happens here, especially the routing
4. context -> themeprovider (for dark/light mode), etc.
5. lib (library)
    5.1 actions -> interaction with the backend
    nextjs apps by default fullstk, so both FE n backendcode
    not completely seperate
    connection bw the FE n BE will be in actions
6. database -> db setup (models etc.)
7. public -> assets
8. styles -> css 
9. types -> TS types
10. .env.local -> local env vars 
This separation makes it easier to manage different configurations for various environments (such as development, testing, and production)


.env -> default, baseline
.env.local -> can override .env vals; for local development; developers use it to set values specific to their setup 

eg: .env => DB_URL=mongodb://<serverProdUrl>:27017/db 
.env.local=>DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/db
