why is react context not supported in server components?

idk

might req browser features


context needs state
state needs client

my guess is that server comps are basically rendered on the server (i.e final HTML prepared, then JS file sent for hydration/adding user interactivity)
there's no place to hold "state" in this whole process anywhere. there's only html, and event handlers etc.
