react code --------bundled, dependency resolved, optimised, minified, made ready for production, turned into | HTML | CSS |  JS  |static files ----------------> prod build 

^^ is build time


prod build--------executed---------> running app

^^ is runtime

now, in SSR the server also executes the final bundled code to get the rendered finished page, so run time happens on the server 

in CSR, the final bundled code is sent to the client, and the client executes it, so run time happens on the client;
